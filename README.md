# FlappyBird
Flappy Bird project to learn Basics of Unity

This game was created as a side project to learn the basics of Unity through a simple game that I've played a lot when I was younger. 
The sprites and background were all found online and all credits go to the creators of those images. 

The game starts with a play button which can be clicked to start the game and space or a left mouse click makes the bird go up.

Using 2d colliders the pillars are detected and ontrigger detections cause the score to increase or gameover.
